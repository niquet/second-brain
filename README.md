# Second Brain

This repository serves as my personal second brain that holds an Obsidian vault for versioning and accessibility across devices. It is a knowledge management system where I can store and organize my notes, thoughts, ideas, and resources using the powerful features of Obsidian.

## Obsidian's Features
- Store and organize your notes and ideas using Markdown syntax
- Create a network of interconnected thoughts with bi-directional linking
- Utilize powerful search and graph visualization to explore your knowledge base
- Collaborate with others by syncing your vault with cloud storage (or just use Git/GitHub)
- Customize the appearance and functionality with plugins and themes
